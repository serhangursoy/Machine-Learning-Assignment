There are two .m files in this project. One is main.m function and other is TestField.m
You can easily delete the TestField file and create your own file to test data.

** main.m Function **
Takes only file path parameter as string. Returns Accuracy matrix for training, accuracy matrix for Test, confuse matrix for training and confuse matrix for test
Below, you can see its prototype;

[accuracyTraining, accuracyTest, cmTraining , cmTest] = main(file_path)

It doesn't do plotting in default settings. If you have a fast processor, you can manually open it. Otherwise you have to wait quite a bit time.
